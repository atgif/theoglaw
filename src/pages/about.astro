		Hi, I’m Olena Gannochenko—a business and transactional attorney based in Fort Bend County. I opened my private practice in 2022 after nearly two decades serving as in-house counsel and General Counsel for an international investment company. Today, I focus on helping small and medium-sized business owners make smart, confident decisions as they start, grow, or transition their companies.

I believe the best legal advice starts with understanding your business. That’s why I take the time to learn how your company operates, what challenges you’re facing, and where you want to go. Whether you're launching a new venture, expanding into new markets, or considering a sale or acquisition, I offer guidance that’s clear, practical, and tailored to your goals. My background includes experience in business organization and structuring, mergers and acquisitions, securities regulation, and cross-border transactions—but I always keep the advice grounded in what works best for you.

I meet clients in person at offices in Katy and the Galleria area, and I also work remotely with both local and international clients. Legal support should feel like a partnership—one where you feel heard, understood, and supported every step of the way.

	Outside of work, I’m a mom of three, a theater and music enthusiast, an ASA-certified sailor, and a passionate traveler—especially when it involves a good road trip. I also give back through volunteer legal work and support for families with children facing medical challenges.
